// Text id is a string which dictates which series of lines of text to use when the player interacts with him. 
// To see what text actually gets printed out, go to scr_game_text!

text_id = "Solitude";

// At different times in the game, you may want Solitude to say different things.
// For this functionality, place obj_solitude in the room, and then add room creation code that changes his text_id to correspond with the proper text.
